### __About Me__
I've always been interested in computer science and now that I'm adult I'd like to finaly follow this desire of mine.
Having been teaching English for many years I've realized how important the language is when it comes to learning, especially learning programming. Knowing the language helps me a lot since there're so many decent courses and videos in English. I love the process of coding and finding solutions. My enthusiasm, willing to learn new things and hopefully theoretical knowledge will help make my lack of experience a temporary thing.
